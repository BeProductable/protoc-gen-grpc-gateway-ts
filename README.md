# protoc-gen-grpc-gateway-ts

`protoc-gen-grpc-gateway-ts` is a Typescript client generator for the [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/) project. It generates idiomatic Typescript clients that connect the web frontend and golang backend fronted by grpc-gateway. 


## Features:
1. idiomatic Typescript clients and messages
2. Supports both One way and server side streaming gRPC calls
3. POJO request construction guarded by message type definitions, which is way easier compare to `grpc-web`
4. No need to use swagger/open api to generate client code for the web.

## Parameters:
### `ts_import_roots`
Since a protoc plugin do not get the import path information as what's specified in `protoc -I`, this parameter gives the plugin the same information to figure out where a specific type is coming from so that it can generate `import` statement at the top of the generated typescript file. Defaults to `$(pwd)`

### `ts_import_root_aliases`
If a project has setup alias for their import. This parameter can be used to keep up with the project setup. It will print out alias instead of relative path in the import statement. Default is "".

### `fetch_module_directory` and `fetch_module_filename`
`protoc-gen-grpc-gateway-ts` will a shared typescript file with communication functions. These two parameters together will determine where the fetch module file is located. Default to `$(pwd)/fetch.pb.ts`

### `use_proto_names`
To keep the same convention with `grpc-gateway` v2 & `protojson`. The field name in message generated by this library is in lowerCamelCase by default. If you prefer to make it stick the same with what is defined in the proto file, this option needs to be set to true.

### `logtostderr`
Turn Ton logging to stderr. Default to false.

### `loglevel`
Defines the logging levels. Default to info. Valid values are: debug, info, warn, error

## Examples:
The following shows how to use the generated typescript code.

```proto
// file: counter.proto
message Request {
  int32 counter = 1;
}

message Response {
  int32 result = 1;
}

service CounterService {
  rpc Increase(Request) returns (Response);
  rpc Increase10X(Request) returns (stream Response);
}
```

```typescript
import {CounterService} from './counter.pb'

// increase the given number once  
async function increase(base: number): Promise<number> {
  const resp = await CounterService.Increase({counter: base})
  return resp.result
} 

// increase the base repeatedly and return all results returned back from server
// the notifier after the request will be called once a result comes back from server streaming
async function increaseRepeatedly(base: number): Promise<number[]> {
  let results = []
  await CounterService.Increase10X({base}, (resp: Response) => {
    result.push(resp.result)
  })

  return results
}

```
